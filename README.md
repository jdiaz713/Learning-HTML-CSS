  Learned the basics of HTML, such as tags, elements, attributes, and declaration.

Project 2:
  Created and styled another basic webpage of a cafe menu, displaying item names along with their prices.
  Further utilized basic tags and attributes, and learned to link stylesheets to a HTML file. Learned basic selectors and pseudo-classes to stylize elements both generally and at certain states.

Project 3:
  Created a webpage displaying three different colored markers, each being a differing primary color.
  Learned about color theory and different ways to represent color values in CSS using predetermined values and functions, and optional arguments each one has. Used a combination of RGB, hexadecimal, and HSL (and their optional alphachannel arguments) to colorize each marker.
